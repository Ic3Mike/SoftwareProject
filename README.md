# Identifying Problem: #
Albania has the best geographical location and by making some researches we saw that Albania lacks a proper site for campgrounds. A proper camping site has to be part of this beautiful country and would help a lot of tourists and its people for visiting and watching better places in the nature. It would make it easier and draw more attention which may also result in helping the economy through tourism.

# Solution of the problem: #
When it comes to the solution, the site must include creating, editing and removing a campsite. Another function that needs to be added are reviews that users can make and sorting these campsites by most reviewed, its rating and its price. The profiles of the user will include information about them such as their first and laste name, their email, phone number and the date that they joined. And last but not least a search bar to find locations by name or its position.

# Objective #
- Make a site for tourists and the locals for camping.
- Make the site easy for the users and include the neccessary functions for the best experience.
- Help the growth of tourism in Albania.

# Development Model: #
For the way of developing our model, we choose the Waterfall Model, since the approach we will have in the project will be done one step at a time. The customers needs are very clear so there won't be any changes in the future and the design can be made easily this way. We will work with the prototype step by step starting with the Front-end first, then the Back-end and then add the database.

# User Requirements: #
Our Camping Site will include the following features to meet the users needs:

    The homepage.
    Register system.
    Users will have the chance to surf the page without signing in.
    The edit feature for the camp
    Comment feature
    Delete option for the users
    A description for every camp added in the site.
